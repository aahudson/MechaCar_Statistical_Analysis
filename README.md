## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
This project contains a linear regression analysis of the MechaCar dataset, focusing on the relationship between MPG and several vehicle attributes. The following diagnostic plots were generated to assess the fit and assumptions of the linear regression model:

## Residuals vs. Fitted Plot

As shown in the above diagnostic plots, the linear regression model appears to fit the data well and satisfies the assumptions of linearity, constant variance, independence, and normality of residuals. The R-squared value for the model was 0.71, indicating that approximately 71% of the variation in MPG can be explained by the predictor variables. Overall, these results suggest that the MechaCar dataset provides valuable insights into the factors that affect MPG in modern cars.
