# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Part I 
This project contains a linear regression analysis of the MechaCar dataset, focusing on the relationship between MPG and several vehicle attributes. The following diagnostic plots were generated to assess the fit and assumptions of the linear regression model:

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

We performed a linear regression analysis to predict the MPG of MechaCar prototypes based on several vehicle attributes. The results of the linear regression analysis are shown below:

The linear regression model output provided indicates that the variables vehicle_length, vehicle_weight, and ground_clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values in the dataset, since their p-values are less than 0.05. This means that these variables are statistically significant predictors of MPG.

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, since the p-value for the overall model is much less than 0.05. This suggests that at least one of the predictor variables is contributing to the model's ability to predict the response variable.

The R-squared value for the model is 0.7149, indicating that approximately 71% of the variation in MPG can be explained by the predictor variables. This suggests that the linear model can predict the MPG of MechaCar prototypes to a certain extent. However, as mentioned before, there may be other factors that are not included in the model that can also affect MPG, and the model may not generalize well to other car models or conditions.

## Part II
Project objective to address the following: 
- The suspension coilâ€™s PSI continuous variable across all manufacturing lots.
- The following PSI metrics for each lot: mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.
